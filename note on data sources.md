# How was FS allocated?

To evaluate FS phase 2 (2012/13 - 2014/15 or 2015/16 depending -- nothing took place 2016/17 since WG hit targets). This welsh gov [report](https://www.gov.wales/sites/default/files/statistics-and-research/2019-04/flying-start-summary-statistics-2015-16.pdf) ([archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20240124124627/https://www.gov.wales/sites/default/files/statistics-and-research/2019-04/flying-start-summary-statistics-2015-16.pdf)) explains the abrupt stop in 2015/16

> Small expansions of the programme into additional areas occurred in 2012-13 and during 2015-16  with **major expansions during 2013-14 and 2014-15**. **The expectation was that the number of  children benefitting from the programme by the end of 2015-16 would be 36,000, but this figure was  in fact met by the end of 2014-15.** Map 1 on page 7 shows the areas, based on postcodes, targeted as  recipients of Flying Start funding, as at 31 March 2015, that is, after two years of expansion. A map  of pre-expansion postcodes (as at 31 March 2012) is included on page 44

This [2019 statistical release](https://www.gov.wales/sites/default/files/statistics-and-research/2019-07/flying-start-summary-statistics-april-2018-to-march-2019-279.pdf) seems to doesn't even cite 2015/2016 as an expansion... it bluntly states (also see chart 1 to see actual numbers benefiting was reached by 2014/15):
> No further expansion took place in 2016-17 or 2017-18


We need to know:

   1. what areas did not previously receive FS in phase 1 (2006) and phase 2
   2. Original ranking list sent by WG for deciding FS
   3. Per head FS costs and extra FS budget for each LA. This determines the number of FS places (i.e. cut-off threshold). This was probably calculated by WG and given to each LA
   4. Data on 0-3 year old living in each LA area. This was probably from SAPE.
   5. Outcomes linked to area. Preferrably at individual level
   6. Supporting data from Welsh Gov

What we have so far:

1. We are recreating from historical sources and desk research (see below)
2. Recreation from DWP data. Cross-referenced against real LA documents where the info is available.
3. ~~Actual data from Phase 2 on funding per LA [here](https://business.senedd.wales/documents/s5011/CYP4-03-12%20Paper%202%20-%20Deputy%20Minister%20or%20Children%20and%20Social%20Services.html?CT=2#_ftn1). Cross referenced with LA documents.~~ cut-off point based on data -- the exact figs the LA used is difficult
4. ~~Recreation from ONS data. Crossed referenced with LA documents~~ see point 3
5. From SAIL data. Power analysis using public data. Good post-natal data is available actually
6. We have oral evidence from Welsh Gov on our facts as well as contemporaneous documents

You would start with Welsh Gov's list of deprived areas and:
1. Start with the most deprived LSOA. Assigned additional FS places until that area is filled. If everywhere in that LSOA was in FS then no additional places are assigned. Move to next LSOA
2. Repeat step 1 until all your target cap is filled.

## Evidence on outreach

There is evidence on outreaach from the Seneed [here](https://business.senedd.wales/documents/s67630/FS%2003%20Members%20of%20the%20all%20Wales%20Flying%20Start%20Managers%20network.pdf) in October 6th 2017 to the national assembly for wales Children, Young People and Education Committee 

Conclusion was that it was a very small element of the programme 
The reasons for each LA is given in this report:
- in Swansea only 37 cases out of 2,903 was outreach 
- Cardiff only has 55 outreach places 
- a really big variety of reasons is given

#### Note on phase 1:
There's a very interesting mention in this [Neath Port Talbot doc](https://democracy.npt.gov.uk/Data/Children,%20Young%20People%20and%20Education%20Cabinet%20Board/20121220/Agenda/$CYPEB-201212-REP-EL-RAW.doc.pdf) on their FS expansion. It indicate first wave is school catchments with: 
>The programme has been operating since 2008 and the Phase 1 eligibility was based  
on school catchment areas with a free school meal take up of 45% and above

Seems to also be backed up by this Bangor [PhD Thesis](https://research.bangor.ac.uk/portal/files/20568225/null):

This seems to be a neath port talbot only thing see `note fsm .. R` and also the Flying Start guidance 2006-7 and 2007-8, Welsh Assembly Government which is [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjg8eaG96T_AhXZPsAKHQ3-CQQQFnoECAkQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdera.ioe.ac.uk%2F533%2F1%2F100225flyingstartguidance0910en.doc&usg=AOvVaw0esYzEDAgshuWw_yS8a2Ki)
> Partnerships should choose the most deprived community school catchments within the local authority, demonstrating that the cap on the population encompassed is not exceeded.  Partnerships should evidence how free school meal eligibility information, the Index of Multiple Deprivation or other relevant factors have been used in selecting the catchment areas.

Ares found from list from appendix 3:

_note: what does the words in front correspond to in the LSOA name?_ is it the mosa name? internal names? 
I think it is the name of the msoa -- which carries a number 
Check butetown: 049 is the MSOA for butetown in 2011 -- this uses assuming 01, 02, 03 etc = A, B ,C etc -- it just doesn't fit with butetown -- 49C is an area outisde the catchment 
Therefore Cardiff must have used 2001 LSOA. 
Wait a source of the 'names' uses is actually in WIMD

# Bridgend 

WIP but no luck -- they are not fans of listing the lsoa or maps 


Not very useful maps below
https://democratic.bridgend.gov.uk/documents/s10094/161004%20Bridgend%20Tackling%20Poverty%20Priorities%202016-17%20Appendix.pdf

another document on FS: https://democratic.bridgend.gov.uk/Data/Children%20&%20Young%20People%20Overview%20&%20Scrutiny%20Committee/201304241400/Agenda/$107573.doc.pdf
Expansion is mentioned in appendix A point 25:
> The 2012-15 Welsh Government expansion of Flying Start has led to the
> development of the service in Wildmill during 2012-13. The expansion areas
> for 2013/14 are Cefn Glas/Ystrad Fawr, Maesteg Park/Oakwood and Brackla
> Meadows/Waunscil Avenue areas of Bridgend

point 18: there were 3 original FS areas 

Again here on p.20 is FS:

>Expand flying start to Brackla, Cefn Glas and Maesteg West
> Expand flying start to Lewiston, Blackmill and Sarn

This odocument goes over which wards were in communities first -- perhaps these were also first wards in FS:

Right here's the eligible area (item 5) up to 2014/15:

# Merthyr Tydfil

Summary: The LSOA areas are included in this [document (also saved as Merthyr doc 1)](http://web.archive.org/web/20240123094704/https://democracy.merthyr.gov.uk/documents/s8504/) in appendix 3. The actual new FS areas added is [here (saved as Merthyr doc 2)](http://web.archive.org/web/20240123094827/https://democracy.merthyr.gov.uk/documents/s15705/Flying%20Start%20Expansion%20Update.pdf).

Other notes:
- The Merthyr Tydfil docs were the first to be discovered and helped us to understand how Flying Start was allocated, 
- The expansion has to be done in two parts. WG sent a list of 0-3 year olds in IB households for each LSOA in the appendix document. Merthyr Tydfil goet the number of 0-3 year olds from SAPE (ONS mid-year estimates for 2009). Combined this gives the proportion of 0-3s in IBH. This is the ranking variable used.
- As in the document in point 1, per child investment was £2,100 in 2009/10. The extra cap number is calculated by Welsh Gov as 403 by 2014/2015.
- See point 2. This comes from SAPE 2009 mid year estimates (ONS)
- Outcomes are areal level IMD.
- Note: All figures in the merthyr docs are rounded
- Merthyr have their own intended KPIs (see doc 1):
	- > The Flying Start programme focuses on delivering on the following: • earlier identification of needs; • the avoidance of reception into the care system; and • the avoidance of other crisis remedial systems such as youth offending teams or substance misuse services. And longer term to: • reduce the number of people with very poor skills; • reduce the rates of criminal behaviour, truancy and drug use; • foster higher employment, increased earnings and better qualifications at the end of schooling; and • It is envisaged that the programme would help to reduce the need for later remedial action, work towards increasing educational attainment and ultimately reduce the proportion of people with very low skills in adulthood
